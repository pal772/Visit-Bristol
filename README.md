## Bugs

  - When i was manual testing on Lighthouse, my mentor noticed a few errors with my headings, which i 
    arranged correctly.
  - When trying to make it responsive on Lighthouse, on mobile devices the image slider were too big.
    With help from my mentor, got sorted out. 
  - Also the image slider, wasnt changing images, had some advice on Slack.
  - My Gallery was displaying all of my images in a row. Was advised to use flex-contain by fellow mentors on Slack.
  - When passing it through the official [ jigsaw validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/), had a <width=100%> 
    on my HTML page (img src) Places to Eat.
    <br>
    With help from Student Tutoring, got sorted by adding it onto Media Queries.
